### What is the Digital Critical Edition?
    
This digital critical Edition and English translation of the French manuscript, Ms. Fr. 640, held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF), presents a rich and unique sixteenth-century technical text in French transcription and English translation for the first time, and situates its contents in their material and historical context. The manuscript provides insights into the material, technical, and intellectual world of the late sixteenth century, and brings a better understanding of how and why nature was investigated, used in art, and collected and appreciated in early modern Europe. The Making and Knowing Project has created this born-digital Edition through a series of collaborative workshops, courses, and conferences that have involved students, craft practitioners, artists, scholars of the humanities and social sciences, natural and computer scientists, and practitioner-scholars from the emerging field of the digital humanities.

### Structure of the Edition
    
The Edition includes four versions of the manuscript text and a rich critical apparatus. Parallel viewing panes allow users to compare two of the following components: a diplomatic (verbatim) transcription of the original French text, a lightly normalized French transcription (punctuation and diacritical marks added), an English translation, and high-definition images of the manuscript fed directly from Gallica, the BnF’s digital library (“Recueil de recettes” n.d.). The Edition also integrates access to the Project’s interpretive resources (also accessible as stand-alone features), including

- essays that discuss the general material, historical, and cultural context of Ms. Fr. 640
- in-depth multimedia essays that focus on the laboratory reconstruction of selected manuscript entries
- field notes from these laboratory reconstructions of select recipes
- principles of transcription, translation, and markup
- editorial and translation comments
- glossary of terms and translation

### What is MsFr640?
    
[Video here of Paging through the manuscript]

Sometime after 1579, an anonymous individual began recording techniques
for many different processes we would now classify as belonging to the
fine arts, crafts, and various techniques and technologies. Over the
course of an unknown span of time (probably until 1588, but certainly no
later than the 1620s), this person filled 170 folios (or 340 single
pages) with closely written text and some hand-drawn figures containing
recipes, instructions, fragmentary notes, firsthand accounts of trials
with many materials and techniques, and observations on myriad subjects,
including drawing instruction, pigment application, dyeing, coloring of
metal, wax, and wood, imitation gem production, making molds and metal
casts, arms and armor, plant and tree cultivation, preservation of
animals, plants, and foodstuffs, distillation of turpentine, and much
else. The resulting manuscript, now housed in the Bibliothèque nationale
de France (BnF) as Ms. Fr. 640, has been preserved since the early
seventeenth century in the binding of Philippe de Béthune, count of
Selles and Charost, apparently the manuscript’s first owner. Entitled
*Choses diverses* (diverse things) on its spine, it entered the King’s
Library (the core of the later Bibliothèque nationale) as part of the
donation in 1662 of the family’s library by Philippe’s son, Hippolyte de
Béthune. Ms. Fr. 640 is a unique record giving insight into many
subjects, but is focused especially on processes and practices of making
things from natural materials. Thus, it is an especially valuable source
for the history of craft and material culture, and for the history of
art and science in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.
Many things about this manuscript are, however, extraordinarily
intriguing and puzzling.
