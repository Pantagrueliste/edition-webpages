# Creation of Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France

The creation of Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France has been the primary goal of the Making and
Knowing Project since it was founded in 2014. The Edition presents the
culmination of over five years of iterative, collaborative, and
interdisciplinary work.

Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France was developed through a series of collaborative workshops, courses, and conferences that have involved students, craft
practitioners, artists, scholars of the humanities and social sciences,
natural and computer scientists, and scholar-practitioners from the
emerging field of the digital humanities.

The first stage of transcription, translation, and encoding of the
manuscript was carried out in a series of paleography and text workshops
(2014–2018) that brought together graduate students (already in
possession of advanced French) to learn to read middle French script
through transcription exercises and then through intensive transcription
and translation of Ms. Fr. 640.

The manuscript’s encoding explores fourteen semantic categories that the
Project deemed meaningful in providing insight into the manuscript:
animal, body part, currency, environment, material, measurement,
medical, music, personal name, place, plant, profession, sensory, and
tool.

Students in the Making and Knowing Project’s laboratory seminars from
2014 to 2018 used the transcriptions and translations to investigate the
materials and techniques contained in the manuscript.

<br/>

These students produced essays that featured their research on texts and
objects, as well as their experiments in reconstructing the technical
processes and recipes in Ms. Fr. 640. The essays gloss entries in Ms.
Fr. 640 and provide contextual information for the manuscript more
generally.

The student essays were edited extensively by members of the Making and
Knowing Project team, after which scholars participating in annual
Working Group Meetings commented upon them. They were edited again in
2019 by the Making and Knowing senior editorial team.

The research apparatus of the Edition also includes a collection of
research essays authored by Working Group members and invited
collaborators that discuss different aspects of the context of Ms. Fr.
640.

In addition, several other features provide assistance to readers,
including editorial comments (signalled by a red asterisk in the
manuscript text), a glossary (accessible as an option in the drop-down
menu within the viewing panes and as a standalone resource), a complete
bibliography, and a list of all 930 entries—“recipe” or entry headings
(titles) in the manuscript.

The final component of the creation of Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France was the prototyping of digital components in digital humanities courses held by the Making and Knowing Project at Columbia University, and the development of the
Edition platform by the Project Digital Team and Performant Software
Solutions. For more information on making the Edition, see Smith, Making
the Edition of Ms. Fr. 640.

## Structure of Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France

Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France includes four versions of the manuscript text and a rich critical apparatus.

Parallel viewing panes allow users to compare two of the following
components:

1. a diplomatic (verbatim) transcription of the original French text,
2. a lightly normalized French transcription (with punctuation and diacritical marks added),
3. an English translation, and
4. high-definition images of the manuscript fed directly from [Gallica](https://gallica.bnf.fr), the BnF’s digital library.

Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France also integrates access to the Project’s interpretive resources (also accessible as stand-alone features), including:

  - Essays that discuss the material, historical, and cultural context of Ms. Fr. 640
  - In-depth multimedia essays that focus on the laboratory reconstruction of selected manuscript entries
  - Field notes from laboratory reconstructions of select recipes
  - Principles of transcription, translation, and encoding
  - Bibliography of works cited
  - Editorial and translation comments
  - Glossary of terms and translation
