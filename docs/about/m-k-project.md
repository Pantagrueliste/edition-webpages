## About the Making and Knowing Project

This critical edition of a manuscript held by the Bibliothèque nationale
de France (BnF), catalogued as Ms. Fr. 640, was created through the work
of team members, students, and collaborators of the Making and Knowing
Project.\[2\] The Project, founded in 2014 by Pamela H. Smith, is a
research and pedagogical initiative in the Center for Science and
Society at Columbia University. The Making and Knowing Project explores
the intersections between historical craft making and scientific
knowing. See

Drawing on techniques from both laboratory and archival research as well
as studio practice and digital humanities, the Making and Knowing
Project aims to cross the science/humanities divide. The Edition of Ms.
Fr. 640 can shed light not only on what kind of knowledge the
manuscript’s anonymous author possessed about techniques and
materials, but also, more broadly, how the work of *making* was related
to *knowing*. Indeed, the overarching theme of the Project and its work
on the Edition has been to show the ways in which *making is an
epistemic activity*, or, in other words, a form of knowing, rather than
simply an applied form of a higher type of knowledge.
