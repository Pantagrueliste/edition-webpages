# About the Manuscript

## What is Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France?

Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France is a Digital Critical Edition of the French manuscript Ms. Fr. 640, held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF). It presents a rich and unique sixteenth-century technical text in French transcription and English translation for the first time, and situates its contents in their material and historical context.

The manuscript provides insights into the material, technical, and
intellectual world of the late sixteenth century, and brings a better
understanding of how and why nature was investigated, used in art, and
collected and appreciated in early modern Europe.

The Making and Knowing Project has created this Edition through a series
of collaborative workshops, courses, and conferences that have involved
students, craft practitioners, artists, scholars of the humanities and
social sciences, natural and computer scientists, and
scholar-practitioners from the emerging field of the digital humanities.

## Structure of Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France

The Edition includes four versions of the manuscript text and a rich
critical apparatus.

Parallel viewing panes allow users to compare two of the following
components:

1. a diplomatic (verbatim) transcription of the original French text,
2. a lightly normalized French transcription (with punctuation and diacritical marks added),
3. an English translation, and
4. high-definition images of the manuscript fed directly from Gallica, the BnF’s digital library (where it is catalogued as “Recueil de recettes” n.d.).

Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France also integrates access to the Project’s interpretive
resources (also accessible as stand-alone features), including:

  - Essays that discuss the general material, historical, and cultural context of Ms. Fr. 640
  - In-depth multimedia essays that focus on the laboratory reconstruction of selected manuscript entries
  - Field notes from laboratory reconstructions of select recipes
  - Principles of transcription, translation, and encoding
  - Bibliography of works cited
  - Editorial and translation comments
  - Glossary of terms and translation

Sometime after 1579, an anonymous individual began recording many
different processes and techniques we would now classify as belonging to
the fine arts, crafts, and various technologies.

Over the course of an unknown span of time (probably until 1588, but
certainly no later than the 1620s), this person filled 170 folios (or
340 single pages) with closely-written text and some hand-drawn figures
containing recipes, instructions, fragmentary notes, firsthand accounts
of trials with many materials and techniques, and observations on myriad
subjects, including drawing instruction, pigment application, dyeing,
coloring of metal, wax, and wood, imitation gem production, making molds
and metal casts, arms and armor, plant and tree cultivation,
preservation of animals, plants, and foodstuffs, distillation of
turpentine, and much else.

The resulting manuscript, now housed in the Bibliothèque nationale de
France (BnF) as Ms. Fr. 640, has been preserved since the early
seventeenth century in the binding of Philippe de Béthune, count of
Selles and Charost, apparently the manuscript’s first owner. Entitled
*Choses diverses* (diverse things) on its spine, it entered the King’s
Library (the core of the later BnF) as part of the donation of the
Béthune family’s library in 1662 by Philippe’s son, Hippolyte de
Béthune.

Ms. Fr. 640 is a unique record giving insight into many subjects, but is
focused especially on processes and practices of making things from
natural materials. Thus, it is an especially valuable source for the
history of craft and material culture, and for the history of art and
science in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Many
things about this manuscript are, however, extraordinarily intriguing
and puzzling.
