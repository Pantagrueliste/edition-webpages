# How to use

## Reading and Browsing the Manuscript

The Edition consists of **four versions of the French manuscript Ms. Fr.
640**:

1. FACSIMILE: Facsimile images of the manuscript pages

2. DIPLOMATIC: Complete diplomatic (verbatim) transcription in French

3. NORMALIZED: Lightly normalized French version

4. TRANSLATION: English translation

All versions can be accessed by navigating to “Read the Manuscript,”
which is also found under “The Text.”

### Dual-pane Display

The manuscript is presented in a dual-pane display, allowing
side-by-side viewing of any combination of two versions of the
manuscript.

![how-to-use-dualpane](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-dualpane-4x6.png)
Side-by-side display of facsimile image and diplomatic French
transcription of folio 4r.


To choose a version, click on the drop-down menu in the upper right
corner of each pane.

![howtouse-dualdropdown-4x6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-dualdropdown-4x6.png)
Drop-down menu for comparison viewing panes, allowing choice
between any combination of two versions of the manuscript.


Quick access to the Glossary is a fourth option to be displayed in
either pane (more about the Glossary below).

To resize the panes, drag the vertical bar dividing the view panes to
increase the size of one pane and decrease the size of the other.

### Facsimile Images

The manuscript facsimile images first appear in a thumbnail grid
overview which can be browsed with the scroll bar in order to navigate
to any folio. Once a page is chosen, the facsimile will appear in the
left pane by default.

Within the pane, the facsimile image can be expanded by clicking on the
\+ and \- symbols at the left side of the folio viewing pane.
Alternatively, choose from three preset magnifications, or use the mouse
or trackpad for other levels of zoom.

To return to the thumbnail grid, click on the grid icon beneath the
expand icons on the left side of the viewing pane.

### Transcriptions and Translations

The layout of the transcription, normalized transcription, and
translation pages mirrors the layout of the facsimile page. This
includes headings, text blocks, marginalia, figures, marks, as well as
distinctive elements described
below.

### Searching

The search bar allows a search in the two French transcriptions, the
English translation, and the Research Essays. 

Search results can be displayed either according to relevance or by folio numbers (listed
sequentially). 

Results can be narrowed by checking only the components of the Edition in which a user wishes to see search results (i.e.,
English Translation, Diplomatic Transcription, Normalized Transcription,
and Research Essays).

  - Search quick tips: see the <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> icon on upper right of returned searches.

  - The search functions by finding all terms entered into the search bar, connecting words with AND.

  - Enclose search terms in quotation marks to treat terms as a phrase. A search phrase enclosed in quotation marks will yield only entries containing the entire phrase.

  - Wildcard searching can be done by including an asterisk \[\*\] for a term fragment. Note that the asterisk is ignored if quotation marks are used. Wildcard search can be used to allow for variations in early modern spelling, or to search for conjugated verb forms, plurals, as well as singular of nouns, etc. Because stemmed searches are not possible, the wildcard search must be used for plurals or conjugations, or, the exact search term must be entered in the search bar.

  - When a search result has been returned, it displays in the left pane of the Edition. Clicking on a result opens the page of the manuscript that contains that entry in the opposite pane. Searching within that page is by means of the browser "find" function. To exit the search function to see a dual pane view, click on “exit search” in the upper left corner of the search results. To return to the search, either use the back arrow in your browser, or return to the Edition’s search bar, where the search term has been retained.


## Resources

Numerous resources serve as tools and companion commentary to the text
of Ms. Fr. 640.

### [List of Entries](/#entries)

The List of Entries can be accessed by navigating to “List of
Entries” found under “The Text.”

It allows navigation of the manuscript by the headings of all 930
“recipes” or entries in Ms. Fr. 640.

The entries can be sorted sequentially as they appear in the manuscript
or alphabetically.

Relevant terms in each entry have been encoded using fourteen semantic
tags that include materials, tools, and places.

To see the full list of tagged terms contained in any given entry, click
on the upper right dropdown arrow. The version to be displayed
(transcription, normalized transcription, and English translation) can
be chosen.

To filter the entries by which semantic tags they contain, click on any
of the tags to see only entries that have terms that are tagged as such.
These can be further refined by clicking on multiple tag types.

For a full list of the tags and their usage, see the Principles of
Encoding.


### Glossary

A Glossary of distinctive terms used in the manuscript can be accessed
by selecting “Glossary” in the dropdown menu of the dual-pane view. It
can also be accessed by selecting “Research and Resources” → “Glossary.”

### Editorial Comments

Editorial Comments marked by a red asterisk occur throughout the
transcription and translation texts of the Edition to clarify structural
features of the text (such as deletions, additions, marks, etc.),
definitions of obscure terms, translation decisions, and historical and
textual information.

Within a manuscript page, click on the asterisk to view its content in a
popup box. Click on the “x” to close the box.

A full listing of the Editorial Comments can be accessed by selecting

In the dual-pane display of the manuscript, these essays appear next to
the manuscript entries they discuss. They can be accessed by clicking on
the essay icon found to the right of the manuscript entry heading.

For the full listing of all essays, navigate to their index page,

essay.

reconstructed, and wrote their laboratory essays can be found linked in
each student Research Essay, and can also be found by navigating to
“Research and Resources” → “Fieldnotes.”
