# How to Use the Edition

## Reading and Browsing the Manuscript

The Edition consists of **four versions of the French manuscript Ms. Fr.
640**:

1. **Facsimile**: Facsimile images of the manuscript pages
2. **Diplomatic**: diplomatic (verbatim) transcription of the original French text
3. **Normalized**: lightly normalized French transcription (with punctuation and diacritical marks added)
4. **Translation**: English translation

All versions can be accessed by navigating to [Read Fr. 640](/#folios).

### Dual-pane Display

The manuscript is presented in a dual-pane display, allowing
side-by-side viewing of any combination of two versions of the
manuscript.

![how-to-use-dualpane](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-dualpane-4x6.png)

*Side-by-side display of facsimile image and diplomatic French transcription of folio 4r.*


To choose a version, click on the drop-down menu in the upper right
corner of each pane.

![howtouse-dualdropdown-4x6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-dualdropdown-4x6.png)

*Drop-down menu for comparison viewing panes, allowing choice between any combination of two versions of the manuscript.*


Quick access to the [Glossary](/#folios/1r/f/1r/glossary) is a fourth option to be displayed in
either pane (more about the Glossary below).


To resize the panes, drag the vertical bar dividing the view panes to
increase the size of one pane and decrease the size of the other.

### Facsimile Images

The manuscript facsimile images first appear in a thumbnail grid
overview which can be browsed with the scroll bar in order to navigate
to any folio. Once a page is chosen, the facsimile will appear in the
left pane by default.

![howtouse-folio-grid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-folio-grid.png)

Within the pane, the facsimile image can be expanded by clicking on the
\+ and \- symbols at the left side of the folio viewing pane.
Alternatively, choose from three preset magnifications, or use the mouse
or trackpad for other levels of zoom.

To return to the thumbnail grid, click on the grid icon <i class="fas fa-th"></i> beneath the
expand icons on the left side of the viewing pane.

### Transcriptions and Translations

The layout of the transcription, normalized transcription, and translation pages mirrors the layout of the facsimile page. This
includes headings, text blocks, marginalia, figures, marks, as well as distinctive elements described below.

### Searching

The search returns results in the two French transcriptions, the English translation, and the Research Essays, which can be narrowed by selecting the desired components.

The results are returned in a "search pane" on the left.

  - Search quick tips: click the <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> icon on the upper right of the search pane. 

  - Search results can be sorted by relevance or by folio (listed sequentially). 

  - Clicking on a result opens the manuscript page that contains the result in the opposite pane. Searching within that page is by means of the browser "find" function, e.g., "ctrl"+"f". 

  - To return to the dual-pane view, click on “exit search” in the upper left corner. To return to the search, use the back arrow in your browser, or return to the search bar, where the search term is retained.

  - The search returns all terms entered into the search bar, connecting words with "and".

  - Enclose search terms in quotation marks to treat terms as a phrase, which will yield only results containing the exact phrase.

  - Wildcard searching can be done by including an asterisk \[\*\] for a term fragment. Note that the asterisk is ignored if quotation marks are used. Wildcard search allow for variations in early modern spelling, for conjugated verb forms, plurals, or singular of nouns, etc. Because stemmed searches are disabled, the wildcard search must be used for plurals or conjugations, or, an exact term must be searched.


## Resources

Numerous resources serve as tools and companion commentary to the text
of Ms. Fr. 640. See [Overview of Resources](/#content/research+resources/overview).


### [List of Entries](/#entries)

The manuscript consists almost entirely of units of text under titles, which the Project has called “entries.” The List of Entries forms an index in order to browse the manuscript.

The entries can be sorted sequentially as they appear in the manuscript or alphabetically.

![howtouse-listentries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-listentries.png)

Relevant terms in each entry have been encoded using fourteen semantic tags. To see the full list of tagged terms contained in any given entry, click on the upper right drop-down arrow. The version to be displayed
(transcription, normalized transcription, and English translation) can be chosen.

![howtouse-listentries-select](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-listentries-select.png)

To filter the entries by their semantic tags, click on the desired tags to view only entries that have those tagged terms. This can be further refined by clicking on multiple tag types.

![howtouse-listentries-terms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-listentries-terms.png)

For a full list of the tags and their usage, see [Principles of Encoding](/#content/research+resources/principles-encoding). 

Each entry has been grouped into up to three of 26 broad categories, displayed on the entry card. See [Entry Categories](/#content/research+resources/categories).

If a Research Essay forms the commentary on a particular entry, a link is provided.

### [Glossary](/#folios/1r/f/1r/glossary)

A Glossary of distinctive terms in the manuscript can be accessed
by selecting “Glossary” in the drop-down menu of the dual-pane view.

Use the alphabetical navigation bar to browse the contents.

![howtouse-glossary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-glossary.png)

The Glossary has a dedicated filtering search which can be used to navigate by the head-word (the manuscript's original French variant) as well as alternate and modern spellings.

How to read a Glossary entry:

Acoustrer (mod. accoutrer): v. to prepare \[COT1611\]
    
  - In this entry, the word as it appears in Ms. Fr. 640 is followed by its modern spelling, its part of speech, and its meaning in English. The key in square brackets indicates the source of the definition, as listed in the [Bibliography](/#/content/research+resources/bibliography). (Some Glossary entries also include language or dialect of origin.)

**A note on early modern spelling:** if a searched word returns no hits in the Glossary, try searching for a shorter string
(e.g., the beginning of the word) or a different spelling. The author-practitioner’s early modern French shows little standardization,
and while the glossary includes common spelling variants, the list is not exhaustive. Common variations are:

  - double vs. single consonant, as in *plate* vs. *platte*

  - homonyms, e.g. aiguille, esguille; alun, alum, alung"


### [Research Essays](/#essays)

Research Essays clarify the text of the manuscript, provide material,
technical, and historical context, and describe student reconstructions
in the Making and Knowing Laboratory.

The Essays can be accessed in two places: 1) within the manuscript pages
and 2) in a dedicated index.

In the dual-pane display of the manuscript, these essays appear next to
the manuscript entries they discuss. They can be accessed by clicking on
the essay icon found to the right of the manuscript entry heading.

![howtouse-folios-essay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-folios-essay.png)

The listing of essays can be viewed as small thumbnails or as cards with the essay’s
abstract. 

![howtouse-essays](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-essays.png)

Click on the small and large grids in the upper right corner.

![howtouse-essay-grids](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-essay-grids.png)

In the large grid view, hover over the author name for their information.

![howtouse-essay-author](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cu-mkp/edition-webpages/master/images/howtouse-essay-author.png)

Click on folio numbers contained in the essays to view that manuscript page (return by clicking the back arrow
in your browser).

The Research Essays are grouped into seven broad categories:

  - **An Introduction**: written by Project and invited scholars, these essay serve as introductory resources and provide overviews of the manuscript and the Project.

  -  **The Manuscript, Ms. Fr. 640**: about the manuscript (its codicology, palaeography, and probable genesis), its relationship to other genres of writing, and the identity of its anonymous author-practitioner.

  - **The Making and Knowing Laboratory**: hands-on work in the Making and Knowing Laboratory, principles of reconstruction, and results and conclusions from experimental work.

  - **Society and Culture**: historical context of the manuscript, and society and culture in sixteenth-century France.

  - **Art and Its Making**: materials, making, and meaning of art, and the training of artists.

  - **Knowing Nature**: investigation, manipulation, and exploration of the materials and principles of nature in Fr.640.

  - **The Making and Knowing Project**: the Making and Knowing Project, including its initiatives, pedagogy, methods, personnel, and collaborators.

To browse the essays by their categories, use the navigation bar on the left.
