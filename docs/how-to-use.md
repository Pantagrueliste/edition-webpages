### Searching

Search quick tips:

- Results given for pages on which all words appear (i.e., default search is AND)
- Use \* for wildcard search (e.g., gol\* = gold, golden, goldsmith, etc.)
- Use “ ” for exact phrases (e.g., “goldsmiths’ forge”)
- Use “exit search” button in upper left of left pane to return to regular browsing
- Full search function guide available here \[link\]
- The search feature for this Edition performs a search in the two French transcriptions, the English translation, and the Research Essays. Search results can be displayed either according to relevance or by folio numbers (listed sequentially). Results can be narrowed by checking only the components of the Edition in which a user wishes to see search results (i.e., English Translation, Diplomatic Transcription, Normalized Transcription, and Research Essays).
- The search functions by searching for all terms entered into the search bar (i.e., the search connects all terms in the search bar with “and”).
- If search terms are enclosed in quotation marks, the terms will be treated as a phrase. A search phrase enclosed in quotation marks will yield only entries containing the entire phrase.
- Wiildcard searching can be done by including an asterisk (\*) for a term fragment. Note that the asterisk is ignored if quotation marks are used. Stemmed searches are not possible, thus the wildcard search must be used for plurals or conjugations, or, the exact search term must be entered in the search bar.
- “Stop words" have been eliminated, so common words, such as “the,” “or,” “a,” “an,” etc., can be searched.
- When a search result has been returned, it displays in the left pane of the Edition. Clicking on a result opens the page of the manuscript that contains that entry in the opposite pane. Searching within that page is by means of the browser Find function. To exit the search function to see a dual pane view, click on “exit search” in the upper left corner of the search results. To return to the search, either use the back arrow in your browser, or return to the Edition’s search bar, where the search term has been retained.
