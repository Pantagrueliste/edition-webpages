# Principles of transcription, translation, and encoding

The transcription, translation, and markup of the manuscript was ‚Äúgrad-sourced‚Äù in a series of paleography and text workshops (2014-2018) that brought together international graduate students (already in possession of advanced French) to become fluent in reading middle French script by intensive transcription and translation of Ms. Fr. 640. From 2016-2018, intensive translation and markup campaigns further refined the text. Allo grad-sourced work was checked by the Making and Knowing Team (Cl√©ment Godbarge, Naomi Rosenkranz, Marc Smith, Pamela Smith, Tillmann Taape, and Tianna Uchacz).

## Principles of Transcription 


The **‚Äúdiplomatic‚Äù transcription** attempts to render the text and marks of the manuscript in type as faithfully in ASCII characters as necessary to assist the reader in gaining a better sense of the original ‚Äî or better still, of visually accessing the facsimile ‚Äî without previous knowledge of French paleography, while also making the contents available for treatment as a data set. Each letter was rendered individually and by a single glyph, disregarding any linguistically irrelevant variations in letterforms, determined by position within the word, ligatures or cursivity, whether conventional in sixteenth-century usage or accidental (see letterforms [*here*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nghSQw5CzTP-UFiO97dCY9LUsaELazVD3Rrre3ERerQ/edit)). Even long **s (**≈ø) (initial and medial) and short **s** (exclusively final), which would have been distinguished in early-modern print, are rendered in the modern form as **s**.

> E.g. ‚Äú≈øans‚Äù is transcribed ‚Äúsans‚Äù

The only exceptions are the following (treated similarly in both transcriptions):

‚Äì Abbreviations are marked up and expanded consistently with the general spelling system of the manuscript.

‚Äì The letters **i**/**j** and **u**/**v**, whether uppercase or lowercase, were not considered distinct graphemes (vowel/consonant) in French before the late seventeenth century. The only formal distinction made in Ms. Fr. 640, following early modern orthography, is between **v** as the initial form and **u** elsewhere. The transcription follows modern usage in distinguishing vowels and consonants, which will not only facilitate reading, but also make full-text word searches more intuitive.

> E.g. ‚Äúvniuersel‚Äù was transcribed ‚Äúuniversel.‚Äù

‚Äì The **√¶** ligature (but not the **≈ì** ligature used in modern French), a form used specifically for Latin and for the Latinate spelling of the prefix **pr√¶-** in French, has been maintained.

The **‚Äúnormalised‚Äù transcription** aims to provide an optimally readable text, based on the principles commonly observed in modern critical editions of middle-French texts for grammatical and lexical disambiguation.

-   Capitalization and punctuation: the liberal use in Ms. Fr. 640 of capitals to mark the beginnings of both independent sentences and articulated clauses has been converted into modern punctuation, and capitals applied only to the initials of sentences and proper nouns.

-   Word separation: blank spaces or apostrophes have been inserted, but no hyphens.

> E.g. ‚Äúlaultre‚Äù normalised as ‚Äúl‚Äôaultre‚Äù

-   Acute accents: **√©** marks stressed, i.e. non-mute, **e** in final syllables, but not in monosyllabic words except for disambiguation between homographs.

> E.g. ‚Äúapres‚Äù is normalised as ‚Äúapr√©s‚Äù according to contemporary convention (rather than modern French ‚Äúapr√®s‚Äù). This also disambiguates between ‚Äúapr√©s‚Äù and ‚Äú√¢pres‚Äù (although the latter does not occur in the manuscript).

-   A grave accent distinguishes **√†** (preposition) from **a** (verb), **l√†** (adverb) from **la** (article), and **o√π** (relative pronoun) from **ou** (conjunction).

-   Occasional diacritics: diereses and cedillas.

> E.g. ‚ÄúNo√´l,‚Äù ‚Äús√ßavoir‚Äù

Both transcriptions document all deletions and changes in the manuscript, even of minor slips of the pen, transcribed as far as possible

Principles of Translation


There is no such thing as a perfect translation. It is always a compromise, requiring interpretation and judgment, shaped by the translator‚Äôs aims and priorities. Discerning the intended meaning of the author-practitioner of Ms. Fr. 640 was particularly challenging because it is a technical text that includes many obscure and long-forgotten materials and techniques, and because the manuscript is an unfinished project.

Any of the numerous moving parts of a sentence‚Äîobscure nouns, vague adverbs, knotty subclauses, sequences of tenses and moods‚Äîmight hold crucial clues to the success of a complex (and often unknown or lost) process. Furthermore, the process of translation was carried out by successive cohorts of students and team members who had no special expertise in the obscure contents of the manuscript. We translated collectively and in parallel with laboratory reconstruction and textual research to interpret the text. The translation underwent multiple campaigns of revision. Our translation of Ms. Fr. 640 aims to avoid over-interpretation and maintain ambiguity, providing as literal and consistent a rendering of the original French as possible. This frequently meant foregoing a more elegant solution in favor of a clunky and at times archaic rendering which preserves the author-practitioners rich, down-to-earth, and occasionally rambling vernacular.

This ‚Äúhands-off‚Äù approach applies first and foremost to technical terms. Many sixteenth-century terms for processes and materials have been obscured or subsumed into different categories in modern art historical terminology. To keep the original meaning in view, we have refrained from applying these modern categories wherever possible. For example, the term *desmen√©e* in an entry on perspective (fol. &lt;62v&gt;) could easily be identified as the ‚Äúvanishing point,‚Äù but instead we opted for the more neutral ‚Äúintersection.‚Äù Similarly, the entries on *or mat* (fol. &lt;66r&gt;) describe a process known as mordant gilding in modern English, but to use that term would be tantamount to imposing a modern technical definition on the author-practitioner‚Äôs understanding of the process. Technical terms for pigments and other materials were a particular challenge. The identity of *azur d‚Äôesmail* and a range of related blue pigments in the manuscript has been an ongoing conundrum. Although we are fairly confident, after extensive research and consultation with experts over many years, that it refers to smalt, a blue glass containing cobalt, we are reluctant to impose our conclusions on the text. For this reason, *azur d‚Äôesmail*, *or mat*, and a range of other terms have been left in the original French, with an editorial note detailing the state of our research as to their identity.

For many French terms, we chose English translations from contemporary dictionaries such as Cotgrave‚Äôs 1611 *Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues*, even if they might seem obscure or archaic to modern readers (see the full list of dictionaries used here \[ADD LINK\]. Even if a word such as ‚Äúmattrass,‚Äù denoting a round-bottomed glass flask, is now rarely used, it is by far the closest equivalent, both etymologically and in terms of its technical meaning, to the French *mattelas*. There are cases, however, where this strategy would have caused more confusion that it is worth. The small paintbrush called *pinceau*, for example, would have been known as a ‚Äúpencil‚Äù in English from the sixteenth until well into the nineteenth century. Being moreover etymologically related to *pinceau*, ‚Äúpencil‚Äù seems in many ways an ideal candidate. However, while one might find a ‚Äúcamel hair pencil‚Äù in a catalogue of specialist art equipment even today, the danger of confusing a brush with a graphite pencil seemed too grave to be left to a disambiguating editorial note on each instance of the word. Instead, on this occasion we translated ‚Äúpaintbrush,‚Äù prioritising a clear reference to the correct tool over the principle of avoiding modern categories.

Another important aim of our translation was to preserve the peculiarities of the author-practitioner‚Äôs language. This includes the odd not-quite-grammatical sentence, but, more importantly, the author-practitioner‚Äôs language of things and processes, which is one of the key elements that tell us something about his ‚Äúmaterial imaginary.‚Äù We paid particular attention to language describing materials as alive and active, with a will of their own. *Azur d‚Äôesmail*, for example, ‚Äúhates more than any other to be ground, especially with water,‚Äù and with good reason, since this would mean that it ‚Äúdies & loses all its color‚Äù (fol. &lt;58v&gt;). While this literal translation may sound quaint to modern readers, for early modern artists and artisans, there would have been nothing unusual in supposing that matter was a live agent that had to be coaxed or subdued into the service of human artifice. By preserving the agency‚Äîgrammatical and semantic‚Äîof materials as well as humans and animals, our translation aims to immerse the reader in the author-practitioner‚Äôs words and world.

The entire translation was collaborative, and this was a challenge to the consistency of translation. We therefore developed protocols to try to limit the range of translations. This, too, can add to awkwardness in phrasing, but we very much strove for a unified voice over the entire manuscript‚Äîa goal, it must be said, that is somewhat at odds with the nature of this compiled document. Consistency in translation of material and process terms was also sought by compiling a glossary over the five years of Text Workshops that specified to participants what word the Project had settled on to translate certain oft-repeated words. This formed the basis of the Glossary that is now available as one of the pane views of the Edition. Editorial Team members then further enforced this consistency by searching for commonly used terms or phrases in a text editing program to make sure that they were translated with the agreed-upon term. For example, we reviewed hundred of variations of the construction *il faut*, determining how to implement our self-imposed consistency rules (‚Äúone needs (to do),‚Äù ‚Äúone ought not,‚Äù or ‚Äúit is necessary,‚Äù depending on context) or depart from them in edge cases. The exhilarating but alarming capacity that digital tools give in enforcing consistency in a document like this has resulted in a truly non-literary piece of literature, as we consciously sacrificed elegance of prose in the English for faithfulness to literal rendering and an attempt not to over-interpret passages whose meaning was unclear. It must also be noted that the Making and Knowing Project created a critical edition of a French manuscript with a research apparatus that is mostly in English, which leads to a somewhat peculiar feature of providing Editorial Comments across all three versions of the text, as well as clarifications in Research Essays, in English only.

Finally, our translation was further constrained by the need to keep encoding matched as much as possible across all three versions of the text. This is desirable because it ensures matching data sets across all versions of the text, allowing for digital analysis of the Project‚Äôs data.

While our translation is faithful to the original and, we hope, useful for researchers from different disciplines, it can in some places be challenging at first read. Our edition provides three different aids to guide the reader across the rockier linguistic territory. Editorial Comments, signalled by a red asterisk, contain information about the historical context and translation decisions. The Glossary found on the reading pane menus provides an alphabetical and searchable list of distinctive terms used in Ms. Fr. 640 that the team identified as needing individual definition, providing citations of source(s) supporting our translation decisions. The Research Essays that accompany this edition often explore linguistic particularities and the interpretation of meaning.
