# Principles of Transcription, Translation, and Encoding

The transcription, translation, and markup of the manuscript was
“grad-sourced” in a series of paleography and text workshops
(2014–2018) that brought together international graduate students to
become fluent in reading middle French script by transcribing and
translating Ms. Fr. 640.

From 2016 to 2018, intensive translation and markup campaigns further
refined the text.

All work was checked and finalized by the Making and Knowing Team: Terry
Catapano, Clément Godbarge, Naomi Rosenkranz, Marc Smith, Pamela Smith,
Tillmann Taape, and Tianna Uchacz.
