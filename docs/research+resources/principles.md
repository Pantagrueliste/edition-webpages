# Principles of Transcription, Translation, and Encoding

The transcription, translation, and markup of the manuscript was
“grad-sourced” in a series of paleography and text workshops
(2014–2018) that brought together international graduate students to
become fluent in reading middle French script by intensive transcription
and translation of Ms. Fr. 640.

From 2016 to 2018, intensive translation and markup campaigns further
refined the text.

All work was checked and finalized by the Making and Knowing Team: Terry
Catapano, Clément Godbarge, Naomi Rosenkranz, Marc Smith, Pamela Smith,
Tillmann Taape, and Tianna Uchacz.

encyclopedias was used during the course of transcription and
translation of Ms. Fr. 640, and as an appendix to the Principles of
Translation.*
