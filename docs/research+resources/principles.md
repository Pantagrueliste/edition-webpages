## Principles of transcription, translation, and encoding

The transcription, translation, and markup of the manuscript was “grad-sourced” in a series of paleography and text workshops (2014-2018) that brought together international graduate students (already in possession of advanced French) to become fluent in reading middle French script by intensive transcription and translation of Ms. Fr. 640. From 2016-2018, intensive translation and markup campaigns further refined the text. Allo grad-sourced work was checked by the Making and Knowing Team (Clément Godbarge, Naomi Rosenkranz, Marc Smith, Pamela Smith, Tillmann Taape, and Tianna Uchacz).
