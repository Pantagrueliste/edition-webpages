# Principles of transcription, translation, and encoding

The transcription, translation, and markup of the manuscript was ‚Äúgrad-sourced‚Äù in a series of paleography and text workshops (2014-2018) that brought together international graduate students (already in possession of advanced French) to become fluent in reading middle French script by intensive transcription and translation of Ms. Fr. 640. From 2016-2018, intensive translation and markup campaigns further refined the text. Allo grad-sourced work was checked by the Making and Knowing Team (Cl√©ment Godbarge, Naomi Rosenkranz, Marc Smith, Pamela Smith, Tillmann Taape, and Tianna Uchacz).

## Principles of Transcription 


The **‚Äúdiplomatic‚Äù transcription** attempts to render the text and marks of the manuscript in type as faithfully in ASCII characters as necessary to assist the reader in gaining a better sense of the original ‚Äî or better still, of visually accessing the facsimile ‚Äî without previous knowledge of French paleography, while also making the contents available for treatment as a data set. Each letter was rendered individually and by a single glyph, disregarding any linguistically irrelevant variations in letterforms, determined by position within the word, ligatures or cursivity, whether conventional in sixteenth-century usage or accidental (see letterforms [*here*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nghSQw5CzTP-UFiO97dCY9LUsaELazVD3Rrre3ERerQ/edit)). Even long **s (**≈ø) (initial and medial) and short **s** (exclusively final), which would have been distinguished in early-modern print, are rendered in the modern form as **s**.

> E.g. ‚Äú≈øans‚Äù is transcribed ‚Äúsans‚Äù

The only exceptions are the following (treated similarly in both transcriptions):

‚Äì Abbreviations are marked up and expanded consistently with the general spelling system of the manuscript.

‚Äì The letters **i**/**j** and **u**/**v**, whether uppercase or lowercase, were not considered distinct graphemes (vowel/consonant) in French before the late seventeenth century. The only formal distinction made in Ms. Fr. 640, following early modern orthography, is between **v** as the initial form and **u** elsewhere. The transcription follows modern usage in distinguishing vowels and consonants, which will not only facilitate reading, but also make full-text word searches more intuitive.

> E.g. ‚Äúvniuersel‚Äù was transcribed ‚Äúuniversel.‚Äù

‚Äì The **√¶** ligature (but not the **≈ì** ligature used in modern French), a form used specifically for Latin and for the Latinate spelling of the prefix **pr√¶-** in French, has been maintained.

The **‚Äúnormalised‚Äù transcription** aims to provide an optimally readable text, based on the principles commonly observed in modern critical editions of middle-French texts for grammatical and lexical disambiguation.

-   Capitalization and punctuation: the liberal use in Ms. Fr. 640 of capitals to mark the beginnings of both independent sentences and articulated clauses has been converted into modern punctuation, and capitals applied only to the initials of sentences and proper nouns.

-   Word separation: blank spaces or apostrophes have been inserted, but no hyphens.

> E.g. ‚Äúlaultre‚Äù normalised as ‚Äúl‚Äôaultre‚Äù

-   Acute accents: **√©** marks stressed, i.e. non-mute, **e** in final syllables, but not in monosyllabic words except for disambiguation between homographs.

> E.g. ‚Äúapres‚Äù is normalised as ‚Äúapr√©s‚Äù according to contemporary convention (rather than modern French ‚Äúapr√®s‚Äù). This also disambiguates between ‚Äúapr√©s‚Äù and ‚Äú√¢pres‚Äù (although the latter does not occur in the manuscript).

-   A grave accent distinguishes **√†** (preposition) from **a** (verb), **l√†** (adverb) from **la** (article), and **o√π** (relative pronoun) from **ou** (conjunction).

-   Occasional diacritics: diereses and cedillas.

> E.g. ‚ÄúNo√´l,‚Äù ‚Äús√ßavoir‚Äù

Both transcriptions document all deletions and changes in the manuscript, even of minor slips of the pen, transcribed as far as possible
