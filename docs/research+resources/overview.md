# Overview

Numerous resources serve as tools and companion commentary to the text
of Ms. Fr. 640.

## Principles of Transcription, Translation, and Encoding

To transform the pages of Ms. Fr. 640 into digital text, the Making and
Knowing Project began transcribing, translating, and encoding Ms. Fr.
640 in 2014 through a series of iterative “grad-sourced” workshops.

The principles and protocols guiding this process grew and evolved into
the resources found in this Edition under “Principles of Transcription,
Translation, and Encoding”

A list of dictionaries and technical encyclopedias was used during the
course of transcription and translation of Ms. Fr. 640, and as an
appendix to the Principles of Translation.

## The Glossary

The Glossary is a record of distinctive terms used in the manuscript
which was compiled in the transcription and translation of the text.

It contains:

  - > Meaning of words

  - > Alternate spellings

  - > Language/dialect of origin

  - > Modern spelling

  - > Part of speech

  - > Bibliographic references

Sample entry:

  - > Acoustrer (mod. accoutrer): v. to prepare \[COT1611\]
    
      - > In this entry, the word as it appears in Ms. Fr. 640 is
        > followed by its modern spelling, its part of speech, and its
        > meaning in English. The key in square brackets indicates the
        > source of the definition, and is listed in the Bibliography.

The glossary can be navigated by clicking on the relevant letter, or by
using the dedicated search box to find a particular word (the search
will return modern and alternative contemporary spellings as well as
head words).

**A note on early modern spelling:** if a word from the manuscript text
returns no hits in the glossary, try searching for a shorter string
(e.g. the beginning of the word) or a different spelling. The
author-practitioner’s early modern French shows little standardization,
and while the glossary includes common spelling variants, the list is
not exhaustive. Common variations are:

  - > double vs. single consonant, as in *plate* vs. *platte*

  - > homonyms, e.g. aiguille, esguille; alun, alum, alung

## Editorial Comments

Editorial Comments marked by a red asterisk occur throughout the
transcription and translation texts of the Edition to clarify structural
features of the text (such as deletions, additions, marks, etc.),
definitions of obscure terms, translation decisions, and historical and
textual information.

A full listing of the Editorial Comments can be accessed by selecting
“Research and Resources” → “List of Editorial Comments.”

## Research Essays

Research Essays clarify the text of the manuscript, provide material,
technical, and historical context, and describe student reconstructions
in the Making and Knowing Laboratory.

Essays have been composed by students as well as invited and Project
scholars.

Essays composed by scholars on the Making and Knowing Team and by
experts invited by the Team primarily provide material, technical,
textual, and historical information about the contents of Ms. Fr. 640.

**Essays composed by students were developed as part of their
participation** in the Making and Knowing Project laboratory seminars
and in courses taught by Project collaborators. The majority of these
essays ask historical questions of the manuscript and its context that
can be illuminated by laboratory research (in combination with more
conventional historical research).

All essays will also be archived in Academic Commons where they can be
downloaded as standalone articles.

The Research Essays are grouped in up to three of seven broad categories
that are navigated by the menu bar on the left:

  - > **An Introduction**: written by Project and invited scholars and
    > serve as introductory resources and provide an overview of the
    > manuscript, the Project, and background information.

  - > **The Manuscript, Ms. Fr. 640**: provide information about the
    > manuscript (its codicology, palaeography, and probable genesis),
    > its relationship to other genres of writing, and the identity of
    > its anonymous author-practitioner.

  - > **The Making and Knowing Laboratory**: discuss hands-on work in
    > the Making and Knowing Laboratory, principles of reconstruction,
    > and results and conclusions from experimental work.

  - > **Society and Culture**: treat the historical context of the
    > manuscript, and society and culture in sixteenth-century France.

  - > **Art and Its Making**: discuss the materials, making, and meaning
    > of art, and the training of artists.  
    > **Knowing Nature**: explore the investigation, manipulation, and
    > exploration of the materials and principles of nature in Ms. Fr.
    > 640.

  - > **The Making and Knowing Project**: discuss the Making and Knowing
    > Project, including its initiatives, pedagogy, methods, personnel,
    > and collaborators.

## Field Notes

Field notes were recorded by students as they carried out their
skill-building exercises, and as they planned, researched,
reconstructed, and wrote their laboratory essays.

The Project required students to keep field notes of every stage of
their research; however, some field notes are more detailed and
comprehensive than others.

Additional photographs taken by the students as they carried out their
research are available in the Project’s repository on Flickr:
<https://www.flickr.com/photos/128418753@N06/>.

For more on how field notes were integrated into the pedagogical
components of the Edition, see Pamela Smith, “Making the Edition of Ms.
Fr. 640.”

## The Bibliography

All works cited in the Edition are compiled in the Bibliography.

Each Research Essay also contains a full bibliography of works cited in
the essay.

Bibliographic references include primary and secondary literature cited
in the glossary and the editorial comments. References included in all
research essays are foreseen to be included in the Bibliography as well.

## List of Entries

The List of Entries allows navigation of the manuscript by the headings
of all 930 “recipes” or entries in Ms. Fr. 640.

Relevant terms in each entry have been encoded using fourteen semantic
tags:

  - > animal

  - > body part

  - > currency

  - > environment

  - > material

  - > measurement

  - > medical

  - > music

  - > personal name

  - > place

  - > plant

  - > profession

  - > sensory

  - > tool

For further information on these tags, please see the Principles of
Encoding.

The Making and Knowing Project has categorized these entries into one or
more of 26 rather loosely-defined categories.

These categories provide a quick overview of processes and materials in
the manuscript. It is important to keep in mind that these categories
have been imposed by the Project on a very diverse set of entries and
should not be taken as definitive or entirely comprehensive. Rather,
they are intended to function as navigational tools.

Pamela Smith, “An Introduction to Ms. Fr. 640 and its
Author-Practitioner.”
