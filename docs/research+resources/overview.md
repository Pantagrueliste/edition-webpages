# Overview

Numerous resources serve as tools and companion commentary to the text
of Ms. Fr. 640.

## [List of Entries](/#entries)

The List of Entries allows navigation of the manuscript by the headings
of all 930 “recipes” or entries in Ms. Fr. 640.

Entries can be filtered by selecting semantic tags that have been used to encode relevant terms in each entry. For further information on these tags, see [Principles of
Encoding](/#content/research+resources/principles-encoding).

## [Entry Categories](/#content/research+resources/categories)

Entries can be faceted through 26 broad categories. These are intended to provide a quick overview of processes and materials and to help navigate
the manuscript. They should not be taken as definitive or comprehensive.

For more information about the manuscript’s contents, see
[Pamela Smith, “An Introduction to Ms. Fr. 640 and its
Author-Practitioner.”](/#essays/ann_300_ie_19)

## [The Glossary](/#folios/1r/f/1r/glossary)

The Glossary is a record of distinctive terms used in the manuscript
which was compiled in the transcription and translation of the text.

It includes:

  - meaning(s) of words according to context
  - bibliographic references for those meanings
  - alternative spellings and modern spelling
  - language or dialect of origin

## [The Bibliography](/#content/research+resources/bibliography)

All works cited in the Edition are compiled in the Bibliography, including primary and secondary literature cited
in the glossary and the editorial comments.

Each Research Essay also contains a full bibliography of works cited in
the essay. These will be included in the general Bibliography for a future release.


## [Principles of Transcription, Translation, and Encoding](/#content/research+resources/principles)

To transform the handwritten pages of Ms. Fr. 640 into digital text, the Making and
Knowing Project began transcribing, translating, and encoding Ms. Fr.
640 in 2014 in a series of “grad-sourced” workshops.

The principles and protocols guiding this process evolved into
the resources found under [Principles of Transcription,
Translation, and Encoding](/#content/research+resources/principles)

A list of [dictionaries and technical encyclopedias](#content/research+resources/dictionaries) was also developed during the
transcription and translation effort.

## [Field Notes]()

\[Coming soon\]

Field notes document students'
skill-building exercises and reconstruction work for their laboratory essays.

While the Project required students to record every stage of
their research, some field notes are more detailed and
comprehensive than others.

Additional photographs taken by the students as they carried out their
research are available in the [Project’s repository on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/128418753@N06/albums).

component of the Edition, see [Pamela Smith, “Making the Edition of Ms.
Fr. 640.”](/#essayx/ann_329_ie_19)
